# shopping-cart

## Getting Started
1. Fork and Clone this repository.
2. Create the project file structure.

You are tasked to build and design the front-end of a new highly-sophisicated locally-built powerhouse meme-tastic shopping cart named... **ShoppingCart.io**.

## Your Tasks
1. Reproduce the layout.
2. Generate the items in the cart with the data given to you. **Item data should not be hardcoded!**
3. Find images that match the product
4. When clicking on the product name, it show and hide (toggle) the description of the product.
5. For the subtotal, add up the total price of all items. **This should not be hardcoded!**

*note: you can use the `cart.svg` file as your image, just include it in your HTML markup*
